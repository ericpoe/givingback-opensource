.. note
In my main job, I write sofware for scientists to use at a non-profit medical research institution.
As part of that job, I might make contributions to open-source projects as long as that helps me do my job -- what kind of contributions, we'll cover later.

In those roles, I am taking advantage of many open source projects and, with the KC PHP User Group, I am taking part in the `PHP Test Fest <https://phptestfest.org/>`_ .
